# Context Free Grammar Simplification in C++

This is an implementation of a Context Free Grammar parser, with a simplification algorithm for academic purposes.

## Getting Started

For running the program in your local machine check out the following steps.

### Installing

For use the the program first you have to clone the current repository.

```[bash]
$ git clone https://github.com/CristianAbrante/context-free-grammar-in-cpp.git
$ cd context-free-grammar-in-cpp
```
and then build the project with the `make` command.

## Running the program

After building the program, you can execute the program with:

```
./cfg.out input-file output-file
```
Where `input-file` is the name of the file that contains the definition of the grammar.
And `output-file` is going to contain the same grammar simplified.
